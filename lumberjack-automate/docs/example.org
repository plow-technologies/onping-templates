This is a simplified example of an automated lumberjack configuration process with example Nix code. It illustrates how a user could install and configure the ~single-well-controllogix~ driver. The workflow and example code make the following assumptions:
- The lumberjack to be configured has already been created (and has a serial number)
- We have a method of reusing existing ~onping-api~ (or other OnPing) routes
- The only driver configuration option for ~single-well-controllogix~ corresponds to calling OnPing's ~/control/logix/location/add~ route
  - Note that this simplifies the example modules presented, because we do not need to deal with any impure intermediate results
- The Haskell executable (referred to as ~lumberjack-automate~) has been deployed on a server

* Diagrams
** Deployment
This illustrates a simplified deployment. ~lumberjack-automate~ is assumed to be deployed on a server having been configured to interact with the flake (i.e. SSH authentication and binary cache setup):
[[./deploy.png]]
The operations of ~lumberjack-automate~ are illustrated below.
** =lumberjack-automate=
This illustrates the processes and interfaces necessary for the driver installation and configuration to occur:
[[./automate.png]]
* Examples
Note that this example is simplified and assumes that we can generate the installation script and a single configuration script for ~single-well-controllogix~ at the same time. This makes the example more concise but in practice, each driver will have several separate modules, which is not illustrated below.
** Flake
As described in the original outline, the configuration framework would be exposed as applied functions from a dedicated flake. The flake would use an input to parameterize functions that generate the configuration scripts using the Nix module system.
#+begin_src nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.follows = "all/nixpkgs";
    all.url = "ssh+git://git@github.com:plow-technologies/all";
    # By default, this is an empty Nix expression. It will
    # be overriden by `lumberjack-automate` to evaluate the
    # modules
    source.url = "path:./noop.nix";
    source.flake = false;
  };
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, all, source, ... }:
    let
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      pkgs = all.legacyPackages.${system};
      # These are functions that evaluate the Nix
      # expression using the modules illustrated
      # below, ultimately generating the configuration
      # scripts
      modules = import ./modules {
        inherit pkgs;
      };
    in
    {
      # We can use `legacyPackages` instead of
      # `packages` in order to nest the several
      # configuration scripts
      legacyPackages = {
        single-well-controllogix =
          modules.single-well-controllogix
            (import source);
        ;
      };
    };
}
#+end_src
** Configuration modules
The configuration framework modules would be defined in the same repository as the flake. For this example, a single module is illustrated that would generate an installation script and a configuration script (to add a location) for ~single-well-controllogix~. In reality, each driver will almost certainly have separate modules for generating different configuration scripts.
#+begin_src nix
# In modules/single-well-controllogix.nix
let
  cfg = config.drivers.single-well-controllogix;
in
{
  options = {
    enable = lib.mkEnableOption
      (lib.mdDoc "single-well-controllogix");

    configuration = lib.mkOption {
      description = lib.mdDoc "...";
      type = lib.submodule {
        options = {
          name = { /* ... */ };
          plcPort = { /* ... */ };
          pollTimeSeconds = { /* ... */ };
          companyName = { /* ... */ };
          siteId = { /* ... */ };
          groupId = { /* ... */ };
          # Optional
          latitude = { /* ... */ };
          longitude = { /* ... */ };
        };
      };
    };
  };

  config =
    let
      # We can also use common options for all modules
      inherit (config.onping)
        url port;

      conf = builtins.toJSON
        (
          cfg.configuration // {
            # This would also be a common option
            lumberjackID = config.lumberjack.id;
          }
        );
      # We can use the package set from `all` to create the package set
      # to install. This could also be a single installation script for
      # all of the modules (instead of per driver). This is one reason
      # that the flake needs to interface directly with `all` (so we
      # know which Nix paths each package corresponds to, etc...)
      packages = utils.mkPackageSet { /**/ };
    in
    lib.mkIf cfg.enable {
      scripts = {
        install = pkgs.writeShellApplication {
          name = "install-swc";
          runtimeInputs = [ pkgs.curl ];
          text = ''
            curl -X POST \\
             ${url}:${toString port}/lumberjack/deploy/package/install \\
              -d '${packages}'
          '';
        };
        # This uses the generated controllogix configuration to add a
        # location with the user input
        configure = pkgs.writeShellApplication {
          name = "configure-swc";
          runtimeInputs = [ pkgs.curl ];
          text = ''
            curl -X POST ${url}:${toString port}/control/logix/location/add \\
              -d '${conf}'
          '';
        };
      };
    };
