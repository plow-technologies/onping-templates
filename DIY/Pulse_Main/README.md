<h1> Features </h1>

The Pulse is a small device that supports remote reading and writing of io lines over mqtt. It hosts an mqtt client that can connect to a broker on your network (mosquitto broker for example). The Pulse client looks for Json messages corresponding to certain io pin names and their values and writes those values in real time. The Pulse also publishes information in a Json message related to all pin values when a line changes, or when prompted. Any other mqtt client can directly read and write the io lines of the Pulse. This establishes a remote control loop.

The board used is the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Basic Proto with an Adafruit Ethernet Featherwing.

<h2> Quick Configuration </h2>

<h3>Configuring your Lumberjack mosquitto broker</h3>

Connect Lumberjack to your home network with an Ethernet cable

With Lumberjack powered up, on personal computer enable wifi and check for available connection `lumberjack-xxxx`, if not available try moving closer to Lumberjack. Once in wifi list click `Connect`, password will be plowtech. (This is not an Internet Connection) 

Open internet browser and in command line type `192.168.123.1` and hit enter. When password page loads, enter `admin` for password.

Click the drop down menu in the top right and go to network. Click where you see `IPv4 Method` and change it to `manual`. Then, click where you see `IP Address` and give the Lumberjack the IP `192.168.168.89`. Ensure that the first 3 bytes are the same as the rest of the devices on the network. Set the default gateway to `192.168.168.1` or the IP of the default gateway. Set `DNS 1` to `127.0.0.1` and `DNS 2` to `8.8.8.8`. Click `Release / Renew`. 

Refresh the page until IPv4 Method stays as `Manual`

While connected to the internet, go to `https://onping.plowtech.net`

Press `ctrl+k` search for `LAS` and select it. Search for the serial number on your Lumberjack. Select your Lumberjack when it shows up.

Go to `Apps`. Search for `mqtt-json-driver` in the available apps list. Click the download button.

Then search for `client-mosquitto-broker` and download it.

Connect your Pulse to the Lumberjack using the USB cable. Connect the Pulse to the switch/ router using an Ethernet cable. Wait until the LED on the pulse turns green.

You've configured the mqtt broker and the pulse has connected to it.

<h2> Creating a new site for your Lumberjack </h2>

With `https://onping.plowtech.net` open press `ctrl+k` and search `Add Site`. Enter the `Add Site` menu by selecting it. Click the `+Site` button at the top of the screen. Name your site anything you like, Site 1 for example. Under company select your company. Under group select your company's users group. Click `Add`.

Next, while still on `https://onping.plowtech.net` again press `ctrl+k` and search for `Add MQTT Driver`. Press enter to select it from the menu. On the new page click `+New Location`. Create an MQTT JSON location with these attributes.

* Name: Pulsejack 1
* Lumberjack URL: IP address written on your Lumberjack
* Lumberjack port: 2000
* Latitude: leave blank
* Longitude: leave blank
* Company: your company name
* Site: your site name
* Group: your company users group

Click `Save`.

<h2> Creating parameters for the pulse in OnPing </h2>

We're going to create a parameter in OnPing that lets us turn the onboard LED on and off.

With `https://onping.plowtech.net` open press `ctrl+k` and search for `MQTT JSON`. Open `MQTT JSON` by selecting it from the menu.

In the company field enter and select the name of your company. In the site field enter and select the name of the site you created. In the `MQTT JSON` field enter and select Pulsejack 1.

Under configure parameters click `Edit Parameters`.

Click `+1 Parameter`

Create the following parameter
* Description: Green Ethernet LED Write
* Topic: pins/set
* Value Selector: .A0
* Time Selector: .unused
* Time Format: LumberjackTime
* Writable: uncheck read only

Then add another parameter
* Description: Green Ethernet LED Read
* Topic: pins/current
* Value Selector: .A0
* Time Selector: .unused
* Time Format: LumberjackTime
* Writable: ensure read only is checked

Click `Save`

The parameters should stay in the parameters table if everything was set up correctly.

Unplug and plug in the Pulse USB to the Lumberjack. Unselect and reselect your Pulsejack 1 MQTT JSON location. You should see 1s for the `value` field of the parameter.

This is the general form for creating a parameter that can be written or read through OnPing. The pin name is given as the value selector, writes are set to publish on the topic `pins/set`, and reads are set to listen to the topic `pins/current`. There is also a topic `pins/current/on_change`, which will only update when values change. For now we won't use this topic, but it's available if you need it.

<h2> Creating an HMI for the Pulse </h3>

With `https://onping.plowtech.net` click on the search bar at the top of the screen. Search for the name of your company. Find your company name and select it. Here, click `Edit Dashboard`, then on the left click `Add Panel`, give the panel a title like `My Pulse HMI` then click `Save Changes`.

Click `+Widget` in the top right. Beside `HMI` click `Add`. Click `Next` on the aspect ratio menu. Click the green arrow in the top left. Under general select control button. For title name it Green Ethernet LED. Click the tag next to the `read parameter`. Search for your company, site, and Pulsejack. Then select Green Ethernet LED Read and select confirm parameters. Then click the tag next to `Write Parameter`, this time select Green Ethernet LED Write and press confirm parameters. 

Finally, add two buttons at the bottom of the menu like this

* Label: On
* Write value: 1
* Active value: 1

* Label: Off
* Write value: 0
* Active value: 0

Click `save`. Then click the wrench in the top right above your widget panel. You should be able to turn the onboard LED on and off using the button!

<h2> Troubleshooting </h2>
<h3>If the parameters do not appear when creating the HMI:</h3>

* Check the settings for mqtt-json-driver and client-mosquitto-broker
  * Go to LAS, select your Lumberjack, and navigate to Apps.
  * Find mqtt-json-driver and client-mosquitto-broker and ensure the ports are the same

  * Check that `allow-anonymous` in client-mosquitto-broker is set to true

* Check that config.yaml in lumberjack/onping-pubsub has the correct information and the mosquitto host and port match the host and port in mosquitto.conf

  config:
  ```
  forward-to-mqtt: true
  mosquitto-host: 127.0.0.1
  mosquitto-port: 1885
  ```

  mosquitto:
  ```
  listener 1885 127.0.0.1
  allow_anonymous true
  ```
  
<h3>Code debugging</h3>

* If the program is failing to upload, press the reset button on the Pulse as soon as compiling finishes and uploading begins
* If the sketch uses too much storage space, or there are compile errors due to function names not being declared, check the installed libraries and ensure they match the versions listed. The current version of the sketch uses 24030 bytes of storage space with the following library versions.
  * Ensure that ArduinoJson is Version 6, not Version 7, as the current code is not compatible with Version 7 and the library for 7 is too large for the Feather.

  Pulse_Main:
  ```
  #include <Ethernet.h>             // Version 2.0.0 
  #include <PubSubClient.h>         // Version 2.6.0
  #include <ArduinoJson.h>          // Version 6.21.5
  #include <Adafruit_SleepyDog.h>   // Version 1.6.4
  ```
* Check to ensure the port used is the same port used in mqtt-json-driver and client-mosquitto-broker

  pulse_settings:
  ```
  uint16_t port = 1884;
  ```
* Check the error codes in the serial monitor if the Pulse is unable to connect to the MQTT broker. MQTT_CONNECT_FAILED is the most common and the issue is usually an incorrect IP Address or port for the MQTT broker.
  * -4 : MQTT_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT - the server didn't respond within the keepalive time
  * -3 : MQTT_CONNECTION_LOST - the network connection was broken
  * -2 : MQTT_CONNECT_FAILED - the network connection failed
  * -1 : MQTT_DISCONNECTED - the client is disconnected cleanly
  * 0 : MQTT_CONNECTED - the client is connected
  * 1 : MQTT_CONNECT_BAD_PROTOCOL - the server doesn't support the requested version of MQTT
  * 2 : MQTT_CONNECT_BAD_CLIENT_ID - the server rejected the client identifier
  * 3 : MQTT_CONNECT_UNAVAILABLE - the server was unable to accept the connection
  * 4 : MQTT_CONNECT_BAD_CREDENTIALS - the username/password were rejected
  * 5 : MQTT_CONNECT_UNAUTHORIZED - the client was not authorized to connect
